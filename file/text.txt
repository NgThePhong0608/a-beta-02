File handling:
    - readfile(file_name) : reads the file and returns the content
    - fread : reads the file and returns the content
    - fopen(file_name, mode) : opens the file in the specified mode
    - fclose(file_name) : closes the file
    - fwrite(file_name, content) : writes the content to the file
    - file_exists(file_name) : checks if the file exists
    - is_file(file_name) : checks if the file is a file
    - is_dir(file_name) : checks if the file is a directory
    - file_get_contents(file_name) : reads the file and returns the content
    - fgets(file_name) : reads the file line by line

File Include:
    - include(file_name) or require(file_name) : includes the file in the current file
    - include will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue
    - require will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script
