Form Handling:
    method: Get and Post
    action: The action attribute specifies where to send the form-data when a form is submitted.


Form Validation:
    This function, test_input(), is used to sanitize the input data before using it. It performs the following tasks:
    trim(): Removes whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.
    stripslashes(): Removes backslashes from the string. This is important for security to prevent SQL injection attacks.
    htmlspecialchars(): Converts special characters to HTML entities. This is crucial for preventing XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

Form Require:
    The required attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form.

Form URL/Email:
    The preg_match() function searches a string for pattern, returning true if the pattern exists, and false otherwise.
